        As arguments get longer, their truth tables  have more rows. Using truth tables to determine their validity can become quite time-consuming. For example, the truth table of the following argument has 16 rows, and can take quite a bit of time to construct.

            <blockquote>If interest rates are raised, the stock market will be hurt. If the stock market is hurt, the economy will slow down. But if interest rates are not raised, inflation will get worse. If inflation gets worse, the economy will slow down. So the economy will slow down.</blockquote>
        
        Since using truth tables to determine validity can be tedious, there is an incentive to find a more efficient way.
            
        <br><br>Arguments such as the one above are built by combining small and basic valid argument forms. This means that if we can recognize the small forms and see how they are put together to form longer arguments, then we can determine validity without constructing truth tables. 

        <br><br><strong>Use the list of common argument forms below to identify the form of the arguments which follow. For each argument, determine if it is valid. </strong>

        <br><br><blockquote>Example: 

        <br><br>1. If it rains, then I won't go out.
        <br>2. I went out.
        <br>∴ Therefore, it didn't rain.
        
        <br><br>R = It rains
        <br>O = I go out/went out
        
        <br><br>1. P ⊃ ~O
        <br>2. O
        <br>∴ ~P

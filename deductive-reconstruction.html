    <div class="question">
        <strong>Here is one strategy for reconstructing and evaluating deductive arguments.</strong>  
        <br><br><strong>Step 1</strong> Identify the premise(s) and conclusion(s) in standard form. Start with the conclusion. 
        <br><strong>Step 2. </strong>Omit any extraneous details. E.g. repetition, tangents, guarding terms, assuring terms.   
        <br><strong>Step 3. </strong>Clarify where necessary. E.g. Replace pronouns with proper nouns, split up sentences.
        <br><strong>Step 4. </strong>Represent the parts of the argument in a chain or tree. 
        <br><strong>Step 5. </strong>Assess each argument and subargument for validity. Add suppressed premises if necessary. 
        <br><strong>Step 6. </strong>Assess the truth of the premises. 
        <br><br>The steps above are a procedural guide. They do not need to be followed in exactly the same order every time. For example, if you add a suppressed premise in step 5, you'll have to go back to step 4 and create a new argument chain or tree to include the suppressed premise, so in some cases, it may make more sense to attempt step 5 before step 4. And for some arguments, it doesn't make sense to attempt each step. For example, Argument 1 below does not have any extrenous details in its original form.  
        <br><br>Complete steps 1-6 for each of the following arguments. In the examples below, I omit step 6 but you should not neglect attempting it. Supressed premises are in bold.

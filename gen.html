            answer: "Not cogent. Biased sample: even if he has an adequate sample size, Tom needs to sample at different times during the morning to be sure that he has a representative sample.

            answer: "Not cogent. Even more clearly than the previous example, this one is a biased sample (grab sampling): even if he has an adequate sample size, Tom needs to sample from different times of the day. Morning doves will likely be disproportionately represented in the morning since they are more likely to be out in the morning than other kinds of birds."

            answer: "This example corrects the problems of the previous two: Tom has sampled from different times during the day. As long as he has taken these samples on multiple different days (preferably in different seasons too), then his sample is representative and his generalization is cogent. The appropriate sample size depends on how precise Tom wants to be in the making his generalization. "

            answer: "Not cogent. Biased sample. Of course, the homeowners will be likely to support a policy that slashes property taxes. Most likely, those on Medicaid (governmental health care support for the elderly) will not be homeowners but will be in nursing home facilities. If the poll had been administered to Medicaid recipients (who are less likely to own homes), the results would likely have been different."

            answer: "This seems a cogent generalization (if the premise is true). Telephone polls are a good way of getting a random sample, and the sample size is large enough—twice the polling standard of 1000—if a good random sampling technique is used."

            answer: "Not cogent. Steve’s problem is that he has gotten a biased sample (grab sampling). Ani Difranco concert-goers are not representative of concert-goers tout court. Since Ani Difranco is very political (and from a feminist perspective), we should expect to see a much higher proportion of such speech at an Ani Difranco concert.

            answer: "Not cogent. Biased sample. We should expect students in detention to be less satisfied, on average, than students generally. Thus, since the principal’s survey was only administered to students in detention, the rate of dissatisfaction will be much higher, which will make the sample unrepresentative and the generalization bad."

            answer: "Not cogent. Bobo’s sample size is small, but the general population is small as well, so that’s not the central problem. The issue is that the info Bobo collects is not likely true because of the psychological bias built into Bobo’s “poll.” Typically, people provide more positive, and less honest, feedback in person than they do anonymously. Consider, for example, how much more vicious hate speech is online than in real life. Some of Bobo’s students are probably lying to him.  "

You alert the company president (and, of course, the public relations officer) that over half of that month’s product is tainted. (Meanwhile, one of your lab technicians inspects the beakers used for pre-examination sample storage and discovers that due to a change in laboratory cleaning protocol this month, a microscopic chemical residue is left on the beakers after cleaning.

With about 28.5 minutes more than the 21 actually delivered by ABC, PBS did an inferior job. I know that ABC’s commercials reap a good deal more cash from the network’s news operation in a month than the alms givers contribute to PBS stations in a year. But I also know that thorough reportage and editing costs no more than sloppy work. The network product is much better, and that’s not what the beggars are claiming.” (Take PBS newscasts as the population.)<br>—George Higgins, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>",

            question: "More than 95% of UVA students earn their degrees. So don’t bother studying tonight—come party with us! There’s a very small chance you’re <i>not</i> going to earn your degree. ",
            answer: "Not cogent. This application is not strong because there is heterogeneity among UVA students with respect to the chance that they will get their degree. For example, some students can get good grades without studying whereas others (most of us) need practice. Some seek out classes because they’ve heard the professor gives out lots of As’s, whereas others take classes they are interested in, regardless of how difficult they seem. For there to be a high percentage chance, like 95% or higher, of getting your degree without studying, then you need to bank on more than just being a UVA student—like being the kind of student who can generally pass classes without studying or being the kind of student who only takes relatively easy classes.

            answer: "Not cogent. The use of “average” in this argument is misleading because the average increase in home price in 2016 is not a good representative of most home price increases in that same year. This is because there is a huge distribution of home price market dynamics in the U.S. In some cities, prices are growing very rapidly, e.g. San Diego. This skews the average. Because there is a big distribution in this case, median would be a more informative measure. "

            answer: "Not cogent for the same reason as above. There is a huge distribution in how much Americans spend on health care. Outliers, e.g. some who must spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, skew the average, so it is not a good representative of most American’s health care costs. "

            answer: "If the distribution of grades in Plum’s class is wacky, e.g. she gives most students 2.5’s, a few get 3’s, none get 3.5’s, and a few get 4’s, then you may want to take Apple’s class, assuming that the distribution is tighter in her class, e.g. because the most common grade is 3 and no one gets below 2.7.

If the willingness to pay 50 cents to participate in a political poll is related to political affiliation (e.g. being a Republican or Democrat), then the sample is biased.

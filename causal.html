            question: "In a high-stakes cybersecurity simulation, four teams are tasked with protecting their networks against a sophisticated virtual threat. By the end of the simulation, some teams managed to thwart the attack completely and some did not. To uncover the reasons behind their successes or failures, the actions and tools used by each team are meticulously examined. The target phenomenon is the successful defense against the cyberattack, and the candidates for necessary and sufficient causes are a firewall upgrade (FU), the use of intrusion detection software (IDS), employee cyber training (ECT), and the implementation of strong password policies (SP).<blockquote><br>•	Team Alpha upgraded their firewall, used intrusion detection software, conducted employee cyber training, and enforced strong password policies. Result: Attack thwarted.<br>•	Team Bravo did not upgrade their firewall, did not use intrusion detection software, but conducted employee cyber training and enforced strong password policies. Result: Attack partially successful.<br>•	Team Charlie upgraded their firewall, did not use intrusion detection software, did not conduct employee cyber training, but enforced strong password policies. Result: Attack partially successful.<br>•	Team Delta upgraded their firewall, used intrusion detection software, did not conduct employee cyber training, and did not enforce strong password policies. Result: Attack thwarted.</blockquote><br>You may want to make a chart to answer these questions. <br><br>(a) Which efforts (firewall upgrade, the use of intrusion detection software, employee cyber training, or the implementation of strong password policies) are possible sufficient causes of a successful defense, if any? <br><br>(b) Which efforts are possible necessary causes of a successful defense, if any? <br><br>(c) Is this an example of rigorous testing for sufficient and necessary causes? Why or why not? ",
            answer: "(a) Possible necessary causes: the use of intrusion detection software (IDS)<br><br>(b) Possible sufficient causes: firewall upgrade (FU) and the use of intrusion detection software (IDS)<br><br> (c) This is a rigorous test for the sufficiency of the four candidate causes because for each cause there are some cases in which it is present, and there are some cases in which the target phenomenon is absent. <br><br>This is also a rigorous test for the necessity of each candidate cause because for each cause there are some cases in which it is absent, and there are some cases in which the target phenomenon is present.

            question: "Some people claim that paying smokers to quit (for each successful month) is the most effective way to get smokers to quit. Explain how you would conduct a rigorous experiment (i.e. rigorous tests for necessary and sufficient causes) to test this hypothesis. ",
            answer: "To test whether paying people is necessary to get them to quit smoking, you should have a control group of some observers who are not paid, and see what happens to them. If they can quit smoking on their own, the payment strategy is not necessary. And you should also make the group of participants large enough to ensure that you observe some people who are actually able to give up smoking. If no one in your study successfully gives up smoking, whether in the group that receives payments or the control group, then you will not be able to make a judgment on whether the payment strategy ought to be ruled out. This is because if no one in the study quits smoking, then you can’t say anything about what is necessary in order to help people quit smoking! <br><br>To test whether paying people is sufficient to get them to quit smoking, you should make sure to observe whether people are successful when they receive payments, of course! (Duh, that’s what you’re testing!) And you should also make the group of participants large enough to ensure that you observe some people who are not successful, whether in the payment or control group. If you do not, then even though you cannot rule the payment strategy out as sufficient, you cannot be confident in ruling it in either because your scope of observation is too narrow.  "

            answer: "I need to make some observations in which the candidate cause (the bark tea) is present. That means I need to do some tests in which I actually study what happens when people drink the bark tea. (Of course!) <br><br>I also need some observations in which the target phenomenon (a cold is cured) is absent. That means I need to try to make some observations about the conditions under which someone’s cold was not cured. <br><br>If I don’t observe any cases in which someone’s cold is not cured, then my efforts in testing for the sufficiency of my tea are useless because I wouldn’t be able to confidently rule out that something else is curing colds, not my tea. To check that my tea itself is enough to cure colds, I need to look at some cases in which colds are not cured and make sure my tea wasn’t ingested. "

            question: "“Washington (UPI)—Rural Americans with locked doors, watchdogs or guns may face as much risk of burglary as neighbors who leave doors unlocked, a federally financed study says. The study, financed in part by a three-year $170,000 grant from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, was based on a survey of nearly 900 families in rural Ohio. Sixty percent of the rural residents surveyed regularly locked doors [A], but were burglarized more often than residents who left doors unlocked [B].” <blockquote>“Locked Doors No Bar to Crime, Study Says,” Santa Barbara, California, <i>Newspress</i>, Wednesday, February 16, 1977</blockquote>",
            answer: "The article excerpt suggests a mysterious idea that goes against common sense: locking your door does not help prevent your house from being burglarized. <br><br>But there is a plausible explanation: B is the cause of A. The observed residents in this study locked their doors more often than others exactly for the reason that they live in an area that has, for some other reason, high rates of burglary. If this is true, then the article’s headline is mistaken—locked doors may indeed be a bar to crime. This fact just doesn’t appear to hold among the observed residents because they live in high-crime areas to begin with."

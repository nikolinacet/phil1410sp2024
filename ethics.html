        1.	In your own words, define objectivism and relativism. <br> <br>

                Objectivism: There is an evaluator-independent vantage point from which the truth or falsity of a (scientific, mathematical, moral, religious, metaphysical) claim can be verified. <br><br>
                Relativism: There is no evaluator-independent vantage point from which the truth or falsity of a (scientific, mathematical, moral, religious, metaphysical) claim can be verified.

        2.	“Corporations act immorally when they contribute to climate change through deforestation.” <br><br>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
        If moral relativism is correct, what does this claim express? <br><br>

                    There is no objective fact of the matter about this, but it is my subjective belief that corporations act immorally when they contribute to climate change through deforestation. Although there is no objective fact of the matter about whether or not corporations should be doing this, it is my preference that they do not do this.

        If moral objectivism is correct, what does this claim express? <br><br>

                <p style="color: blue;">
                    There is an objective fact of the matter about this issue. That means this claim is true not just because I say so but because it can be confirmed on grounds independent of the fact that I believe this claim is true—like some morally relevant reasons that others can appreciate. It’s like the claim that the earth is round or that 2+2=4. The truth of these claims does not depend on my accepting that they are true.

        3.	One argument against relativism is the following:
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
            1. When one person says X is morally acceptable, and someone else says X, the same thing, is morally unacceptable, they are disagreeing.<br>
            2. However, if relativism is correct, there is no disagreement about X.<br>
            ∴ Therefore, relativism cannot be correct.
        </p>   
        Explain premise 2. Why is it the case, according to relativism, that there can be no genuine disagreement? <br><br>
        <button onclick="toggleText('answer3')">Show/Hide Answer</button>
        <div id="answer3" class="hidden-text">
        <p style="color: blue;">
            If relativism is true, when two people, A and B, make different claims about X, there is no real disagreement because A and B are really talking about two different things. A is expressing her preference and B is expressing his preference. That A and B are expressing mere preferences, as opposed to objective truths, follows from the meaning of relativism. Given that a genuine disagreement can only exist when two people are discussing the same topic, A and B are not really disagreeing. 
        </p>
        </div>
    </div>
       
       
    <div class="container">
        4.	Another argument against relativism is the following: <br>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
            1.	We are sometimes wrong in our moral evaluations.</br>
            2.	But if relativism were true, as long as one is speaking sincerely, they could never be wrong in their moral evaluations.</br>
            ∴    Therefore, relativism cannot be correct. </br>
        </p>
        Why should we believe premise 1 is true? <br><br>
        <button onclick="toggleText('answer4a')">Show/Hide Answer</button>
        <div id="answer4a" class="hidden-text">
        <p style="color: blue;">
            One reason: When looking back through history, we sometimes want to say people in the past were wrong in their moral judgments (different from the question of whether they are blameworthy). For example, we want to say people in power were wrong in openly accepting slavery as a part of their society. 
        </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        Premise 2 follows from the definition of relativism. Explain how. <br><br>
        <button onclick="toggleText('answer4b')">Show/Hide Answer</button>
        <div id="answer4b" class="hidden-text">
        <p style="color: blue;">
            According to relativism, when people express moral claims, they are reporting on mere preferences. As long as they are reporting their sincere preferences, they are not saying anything false. For example, if it is my genuine belief that slavery is morally permissible, according to relativism, I am not saying anything false if I express this belief.

        5.	In the last paragraph of his essay, Frankfurt gives an argument against the turn toward sincerity at the cost of objectivity. First, paraphrase this argument in your own words.  Second, explain in detail what you think of the argument. Does it convince you? Why or why not? <br><br>
        <button onclick="toggleText('answer5')">Show/Hide Answer</button>
        <div id="answer5" class="hidden-text">
        <p style="color: blue;">
        
            Frankfurt’s argument: <br><br>

            Turning towards sincerity and away from objectivity is self-defeating. The proponent of sincerity (in the context in which Frankfurt is using the word sincerity) rejects the intelligibility of objective truth and instead aims to express only themselves honestly. <br><br>

            But if there is no such thing as objective, determinate truth, it follows that there is no objective, determinate truth about the self. So the proponent of sincerity has set themselves up to fail. <br><br>

            Furthermore, (a separate point) it’s far from obvious that the truth about ourselves is easier to discern than the truth about the external world. We are complex creatures, after all. <br><br>

            answer: "Violates conservativeness. We have no good reason for positing some whole new breed of rats—especially if the claim is that they evolved in Bobo's apartment only. This would violate what we know about how evolution works (i.e., we probably need a much larger population for this to happen than the population of rats that are contained in only Bobo's apartment). Furthermore, the explanation lacks power since a better explanation that applied to a wider range of circumstances is simply that the rats were not taking the bait."

            answer: "Violates modesty. A more modest explanation is that this is someone who looks like Bozo, whether or not it is Bozo’s son. The explanation might also lack depth since we would want to know why Bobo had never seen or heard of Bozo’s son for 20 years."

            answer: "Violates Conservativeness: To accept this explanation, we would have to give up a lot of other facts we know there is good reason to believe are true. For example, we would have to give up the following beliefs: <blockquote>-the ancient Egyptians built the Great Pyramids of Giza <br>-there is no publicly verifiable evidence that aliens ever interacted with humans <br>-there is no publicly verifiable evidence for the existence of some ancient, yet technologically advanced, civilization  <br>-contemporary archeological science is reliable </blockquote>"

What counts as a challenge? Almost anything might! For example, a “challenge” might simply be loneliness or it might be a having a hard time picking a restaurant for a dinner date."

            answer: "Violates Simplicity (Ockham’s Razor): This posits the existence of novel, highly unusual entities to explain what’s going on when it doesn’t need to. Analogously, this is like saying that it rained yesterday because there are millions of tiny little people who live in the sky, watched a sad movie, and started to cry at the same time. Before we settle on this wild explanation, we should rule out all the other explanations that do not posit the existence of novel, highly unusual entities.   "

This is because they have souls. Do you think this is a bad (i.e. not cogent) inference like the one above? Why or why not? <br><br>Note: The following is not an acceptable answer to this question: People disagree about whether or not souls exist and what it would take to prove that they exist, so there is no conclusive answer as to whether or not this is a good inference. People disagree about all sorts of things, including basic empirical facts, but that is not evidence in and of itself that (1) the disagreement is warranted and (2) that there is no matter of fact that could resolve the disagreement.

            answer: "Violate Modesty: Bobo’s plants are wilting, but that by itself does not mean that he is a terrible gardener overall. Perhaps he is just making one very specific mistake, like watering the plants too much, but he’s a decent gardener otherwise. In other words, this explanation claims more than is needed to explain an observation. It is too general.  "

            answer: "Violates Completeness. Yes, scientific conclusions are typically based on inductive reasoning so they are not 100% provable (there’s always the possibility of a conflicting empirical observation in the future). But this explanation does nothing to address what science gives good reason to believe is very probably true, namely that the emission of greenhouse gasses does contribute to global warming.

These youngsters had, in fact, been selected at random from among their classmates. . . . When they were retested several months later, however, this time with a genuine intelligence test, those falsely identified ‘spurters’ did, indeed, show a significant improvement over their fellow students. This result can be explained by the fact that because the teachers expected them to do well, their perceptions of each student’s ability rose and those children’s own self-image was enhanced.”<br>—David Lewis and James Greene, <i>Thinking Better</i>",
            answer: "P1. Observations: Children chosen at random and identified as “spurters” to their teachers showed significant improvement over their fellow students on an intelligence test. <br><br>P2.

            question: "Freud argued that repression and resistance are two important mechanisms of our minds. Repression is the mechanism by which we push out of awareness and into our unconscious memories of deeply traumatic childhood experiences. Resistance is the mechanism by which we refuse to allow these repressed memories to be brought back to the surface. When people insist that they have no repressed memories, then, Freud considers this to be evidence for the presence of resistance, which is itself evidence for the existence of repression.",
            answer: "P1. Observation: Some people insist they have no repressed memories. <br><br>P2. Explanation: Insisting one has no repressed memories is evidence for resistance and repression, two mental mechanisms by which we push out of conscious awareness memories of traumatic childhood experiences. (Hypothesis A)<br><br>P3. Comparison: When people insist they have no repressed memories, it couldn’t be because they really have no repressed memories. <br><br>∴ When one insists they have no repressed memories, that is evidence of repressed memories.

            question: "Some believers in the paranormal hold that skeptical attitudes can inhibit paranormal results. A professor at Bath University in England combines this rationalization with the idea that psychic powers work backward and forward in time; he suggests, in apparent seriousness, that the failure of attempted experiments to prove psychic forces is actually evidence in favor of parapsychology since skeptics reading about successful experiments afterward actually project their skepticism back in time to inhibit the experiment!",
            answer: "P1. Observation: Attempted experiments to prove psychic forces, i.e. parapsychology, have failed. <br><br>P2. Explanation: The experiments seem to fail because psychic powers work backward and forward in time, so when skeptics read about the results of successful experiments, they project their skepticism back in time and inhibit the experiment. The apparent failure of experiments is in reality evidence of their success! (Hypothesis A)<br><br>P3.

            question: "Death and disaster provide a convincing argument that, contrary to the persistent notion, women are not the weaker sex. Archeologist Donald Grayson of the University of Washington has found some evidence in the Donner Party catastrophe. It's a favorite of macabre schoolchildren. Delayed on the way west in 1846, 87 pioneers were stranded in late October by heavy snows in the Sierra. Nearly half the party died before an April rescue, the survivors cannibalizing the dead. Thirty of the 40 who died were men and, says Grayson, most of the male deaths occurred before that of a single woman. Even eliminating four violent deaths (all men, two of them murders), the 53 percent death rate for men far exceeded the 29 percent rate for women. Men were exposed more frequently to the elements, since they did the hunting and tree cutting. But Grayson believes it's unlikely such factors fully explain the statistics. For instance, of 15 Donner Party members who attempted to snowshoe out in late December, all five women survived while eight of the ten men died. And chivalry didn't make the difference, the researchers say, since women got no more food than men. &quotIt comes down to physiology,&quot says Grayson. &quotMen are evolutionarily built for aggression. Women are built for giving birth, and the long haul that involves.&quot <br>—<i>In Health</i>",

            question: "Review the article below and provide a standard form reconstruction of an inference to the best explanation based on the argument the article provides. <br><br>Is the article’s argument cogent? Explain why or why not. In addressing this question, you should be assessing how well the proposed explanation adheres to the seven explanatory virtues compared to other possible explanations, i.e. comparisons (P3).<br><br><a href='https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-evolutionary-reasons-we-are-drawn-to-horror-movies-and-haunted-houses1/'>The Evolutionary Reasons We Are Drawn to Horror Movies and Haunted Houses</a>. <br><br><embed src='horror.webp' width='100%'' height='100%px'>",
            answer: "P1. Observation: Humans and other animals are morbidly curious. We love risky play. Sometimes the danger in risky play is experienced vicariously, like in violent video games, scary stories, and movies about monsters, catastrophic events like volcano eruptions, pandemics, and dangerous storms. Sometimes the danger in risky play is pretend, like in staged haunted houses. And sometimes the danger in risky play is real, but low-level, as in the story of the captive monkeys who kept opening the lid to a box of snakes.<br><br>P2. Explanation: Humans and other animals are morbidly curious because morbid curiosity is evolutionarily advantageous. It allows us to gain information about dangerous situations, gives us practice in dealing with scary experiences, helps to manage anxiety, and even fosters cooperation. (Hypothesis A) <br><br>P3. Comparison: No other hypothesis better explains the observations on P1, including the following:  <blockquote>•	True crime podcasts that detail violent crimes are really popular. This is not because of an evolutionary reason that has to do with exposing ourselves to a low level of danger and vicariously learning something. It’s quite the opposite. People like stories about other people getting hurt because it makes them feel safe—“Whew! Glad that’s not me!” <br><br>•	In some cases, morbid curiosity is better explained by something other than evolutionary psychology because some cases of risky human play do not seem evolutionarily adaptive, i.e. good for survival and reproduction. For example, some people have extreme sexual fetishes which cause them physical harm. <br><br>•	Generalizing from the example above, there are a host of risky behaviors driven by morbid curiosity that are better explained, or at least primarily explained, by cultural, societal, or economic factors rather than evolutionary ones. For example: People like to go to “haunted” houses on Halloween because it is a cultural tradition, just like eating turkey is a cultural tradition for Americans on Thanksgiving. Violent video games, like all video games, are not as popular as they are because they exploit an evolutionarily adaptive affinity for risky play, but rather because they are made to exploit cognitive mechanisms that make them addictive. (This is a version of a common objection levied against many claims in evolutionary psychology.)</blockquote>∴ Morbid human curiosity is a function of evolution, not merely a cultural phenomenon. (Hypothesis A is true.) <br><br>What do you think of the alternative explanations proposed above? Do any of them better align with the seven explanatory virtues than the explanation offered in the article? "

            question: "The following study offers a mathematical model of the relationship between the number of people hypothesized to be involved in a conspiracy and the likelihood of keeping that conspiracy secret. <br><br> Skim the Introduction, the first few paragraphs of the Discussion, and look at the figures in the Results. (This is a quick heuristic for getting a sense of what many academic articles in math and science are about.) What do the authors of the paper say is the relationship between the number of people involved in a conspiracy and the likelihood of keeping the conspiracy a secret? In giving your answer, cite at least one specific set of numbers. <br><br> <embed src='On the Viability of Conspiratorial Beliefs.pdf' width='1000px'' height='700px'><br><br>As we might predict using common sense, the model predicts that the greater the number of conspirators involved in a conspiracy, the faster it will fail. i.e. the faster the secret the conspirators are hiding will get out. <br><br>Notably, the model makes a charitable assumption: its predictions concern only the likelihood that a conspiracy will fail due to intrinsic failure—someone involved in the conspiracy intentionally or accidentally spills the beans. But, of course, secrets can also be revealed extrinsically when an outsider discovers them or accidentally stumbles upon them.<br><br>Some interesting numbers from the model’s predictions: <blockquote>•	To sustain a conspiracy (keep the secret quiet) for 5 years, the model predicts that less than 2531 people may be involved. To sustain a conspiracy for 10 years, less than 1257 people may be involved. For 15 years and longer, less than 1000 people may be involved. <br><br>•	The above numbers are at odds with how many people would need to be involved to sustain major conspiracies. For example, if the moon landing was staged, it would take over 400,000 people to keep the secret. This number is derived from the number of people employed by NASA in 1965. To keep a secret about the true purpose of vaccines, it would take 22,000 people staying quiet, the number of employees at the CDC and WHO combined. Given the large number of people involved, the model predicts that for each of these large conspiracies, the probability that they would succeed for even more than 5 years (much less decades!) is exceedingly low.  </blockquote><br>Where do these model numbers come from? To answer that, we can look at the “Parameter Estimation” section of the paper which explains that the model is based, in part, on historical examples of the conditions under which confirmed conspiracies were revealed. In case you missed it, those confirmed conspiracies were: <blockquote>•	The National Security Agency (NSA) PRISM affair—The staggering extent of spying by the NSA and its allies on civilian internet users was exposed by contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. The extent of the eavesdropping was unprecedented, including the tapping of fiber-optic cables, phone calls from allied heads of state and a huge amount of meta-data.<br><br>•	The Tuskegee syphilis experiment—In 1932 the US Public Health Service began an observational study on African-American men who had contracted syphilis in Alabama. The study became unethical in the mid 1940s, when penicillin was shown to effectively cure the ailment and yet was not given to the infected men. Ethical questions about the research were raised in the mid 1960s, and finally exposed by researcher Dr. Peter Buxtun in 1972.<br><br>•	The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) forensic scandal—Dr. Frederic Whitehurst wrote hundreds of letters to his superiors detailing the pseudoscientific nature of many of the FBI forensics tests. The dubious nature of these protocols resulted in a large number of innocent men being detained for decades, several of whom were executed for these crimes or died in prison, before Whitehurst exposed the debacle in 1998. A subsequent report by the FBI and Department of Justice found that at least 26 of the 28 dedicated hair analysts gave misleading testimony, prompting an ongoing massive re-evaluation of unsafe convictions. </blockquote><br><br>What do you think of this model?

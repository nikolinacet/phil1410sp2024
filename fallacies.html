Why should you feel guilty for seeking your own happiness when that's what everyone else is doing, too?”<br><br>-Harry Browne, "The Unselfishness Trap", from How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World (1973)</blockquote>Just because everyone else is a selfish jerk doesn’t make it okay!<br><br>But not every appeal to popular opinion is unjustified, as in:<blockquote>Petticoats are no longer in style. They haven’t been worn by the majority of women for over 100 years.</blockquote>This is not an instance of fallacious ad populum, even though it is an appeal to popularity, because what counts as “in style” is defined by what is popular. The appeal to popularity in this case is justified.<br><br>Each of the arguments below is similar in structure to one of the common fallacy forms, but the jury is out about whether it is really fallacious.
